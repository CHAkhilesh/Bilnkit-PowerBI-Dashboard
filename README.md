### Project Title
**Blinkit Insights: Sales & Outlet Performance Dashboard**
A dynamic Power BI dashboard designed to analyze Blinkit’s sales performance, outlet efficiency, and customer engagement through data-driven insights on outlet type, size, and location.


### 📝 Short Description / Purpose
The **Blinkit Sales Analytics Dashboard** provides a comprehensive view of key business metrics such as total sales, average sales, item counts, and customer ratings across various outlet types, sizes, and locations.  
This dashboard helps management identify top-performing categories, optimize outlet strategies, and enhance sales performance through data-backed decisions.


### ⚙️ Tech Stack
The dashboard was built using the following tools and technologies:
- 📊 **Power BI Desktop** – Main data visualization platform used for report creation.  
- ⚙️ **Power Query** – Data transformation and cleaning layer for reshaping and preparing the data.  
- 🧮 **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)** – Used for calculated measures, dynamic visuals, and conditional logic.  
- 🧠 **Data Modeling** – Relationships established among tables (Outlets, Items, Sales) to enable cross-filtering and aggregation.  
- 📁 **File Format** – `.pbix` for dashboard development and `.png` for report preview.


### 🗂️ Data Source

This structure enables multi-dimensional analysis of Blinkit’s retail operations.
